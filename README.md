# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server + Feishu OAuth

This is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that supports remote MCP connections, with Feishu OAuth built-in.

You can deploy it to your own Cloudflare account, and after you create your own Feishu OAuth client app, you'll have a fully functional remote MCP server that you can build off. Users will be able to connect to your MCP server by signing in with their Feishu account.

You can use this as a reference example for how to integrate other OAuth providers with an MCP server deployed to Cloudflare, using the [`workers-oauth-provider` library](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider).

The MCP server (powered by [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)):

* Acts as OAuth _Server_ to your MCP clients
* Acts as OAuth _Client_ to your _real_ OAuth server (in this case, Feishu)

## Getting Started

Clone the repo directly & install dependencies: `npm install`.

Alternatively, you can use the command line below to get the remote MCP Server created on your local machine:
```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-mcp-server --template=cloudflare/ai/demos/remote-mcp-github-oauth
```

### For Production
Create a new Feishu application on the [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/):
1. Go to the [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/) and log in
2. Click "Developer Console" and create a new application
3. In the application settings:
   - Go to "Security Settings" and add the redirect URL: `https://mcp-feishu-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/callback`
   - Go to "Permission & Scopes" and add the following permissions:
     - "获取用户 ID" (auth:user.id:read)
     - "获取用户任务信息" (task:task:read)
     - "获取用户授权凭证" (offline_access)
   - Note your App ID and App Secret
4. Set secrets via Wrangler
```bash
wrangler secret put FEISHU_APP_ID
wrangler secret put FEISHU_APP_SECRET
wrangler secret put COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY # add any random string here e.g. openssl rand -hex 32
```
#### Set up a KV namespace
- Create the KV namespace:
`wrangler kv:namespace create "OAUTH_KV"`
- Update the Wrangler file with the KV ID

#### Deploy & Test
Deploy the MCP server to make it available on your workers.dev domain
` wrangler deploy`

Test the remote server using [Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector):

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest
```
Enter `https://mcp-feishu-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse` and hit connect. Once you go through the authentication flow, you'll see the Tools working.

You now have a remote MCP server deployed with Feishu OAuth authentication!

### Access Control

This MCP server uses Feishu OAuth for authentication. All authenticated Feishu users can access basic tools like "add" and "userInfoFeishu".

The "generateImage" tool is restricted to specific Feishu users listed in the `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` configuration:

```typescript
// Add Feishu user IDs for image generation access
const ALLOWED_USER_IDS = new Set([
  'ou_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  'ou_yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy'
]);
```

You can get a user's ID by using the "userInfoFeishu" tool and looking at the `user_id` field in the response.

### Access the remote MCP server from Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop and navigate to Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config. This opens the configuration file that controls which MCP servers Claude can access.

Replace the content with the following configuration. Once you restart Claude Desktop, a browser window will open showing your Feishu OAuth login page. Complete the authentication flow to grant Claude access to your MCP server. After you grant access, the tools will become available for you to use.

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "math": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp-feishu-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once the Tools (under 🔨) show up in the interface, you can ask Claude to use them. For example: "Could you use the math tool to add 23 and 19?". Claude should invoke the tool and show the result generated by the MCP server.

### For Local Development
If you'd like to iterate and test your MCP server, you can do so in local development. This will require you to create another Feishu application or configure your existing one:
1. In your Feishu application settings:
   - Go to "Security Settings" and add the redirect URL: `http://localhost:8788/callback`
   - Make sure you have the following permissions:
     - "获取用户 ID" (auth:user.id:read)
     - "获取用户任务信息" (task:task:read)
     - "获取用户授权凭证" (offline_access)
   - Note your App ID and App Secret
2. Create a `.dev.vars` file in your project root with:
```
FEISHU_APP_ID=your_development_feishu_app_id
FEISHU_APP_SECRET=your_development_feishu_app_secret
COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=any_random_string_here
```

#### Develop & Test
Run the server locally to make it available at `http://localhost:8788`
`wrangler dev`

To test the local server, enter `http://localhost:8788/sse` into Inspector and hit connect. Once you follow the prompts, you'll be able to "List Tools".

#### Using Claude and other MCP Clients

When using Claude to connect to your remote MCP server, you may see some error messages. This is because Claude Desktop doesn't yet support remote MCP servers, so it sometimes gets confused. To verify whether the MCP server is connected, hover over the 🔨 icon in the bottom right corner of Claude's interface. You should see your tools available there.

#### Using Cursor and other MCP Clients

To connect Cursor with your MCP server, choose `Type`: "Command" and in the `Command` field, combine the command and args fields into one (e.g. `npx mcp-remote https://<your-worker-name>.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse`).

Note that while Cursor supports HTTP+SSE servers, it doesn't support authentication, so you still need to use `mcp-remote` (and to use a STDIO server, not an HTTP one).

You can connect your MCP server to other MCP clients like Windsurf by opening the client's configuration file, adding the same JSON that was used for the Claude setup, and restarting the MCP client.

## How does it work?

#### OAuth Provider
The OAuth Provider library serves as a complete OAuth 2.1 server implementation for Cloudflare Workers. It handles the complexities of the OAuth flow, including token issuance, validation, and management. In this project, it plays the dual role of:

- Authenticating MCP clients that connect to your server
- Managing the connection to Feishu's OAuth services
- Securely storing tokens and authentication state in KV storage

#### Durable MCP
Durable MCP extends the base MCP functionality with Cloudflare's Durable Objects, providing:
- Persistent state management for your MCP server
- Secure storage of authentication context between requests
- Access to authenticated user information via `this.props`
- Support for conditional tool availability based on user identity

#### MCP Remote
The MCP Remote library enables your server to expose tools that can be invoked by MCP clients like the Inspector. It:
- Defines the protocol for communication between clients and your server
- Provides a structured way to define tools
- Handles serialization and deserialization of requests and responses
- Maintains the Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection between clients and your server
